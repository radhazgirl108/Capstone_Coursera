    "## Business problem\n",
    "The City of New York is famous for its excelllent cuisines. It's food culture includes an variety of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history. Recently, Vegan Sushi restaurants have become so popular in the United States now that veganism is highly popular in the young hip cultural. Thus, it appears that there is one on every corner and not only in major cities but also have started making apperances in smaller cities internationally. Starting a Vegan sushi restaurant can be a great business opportunity, but we need to distinguish ourselves from others to enjoy steady long-term successes."

    "## Find a suitable location\n",
    "If we plan a real restaurant that can demand higher prices for fresh fish and seafood replacement, delivered daily from Japan, we need to focus on neighborhoods and outlets that already attract a sophisticated Vegans as well as the origianl Japanese clientele. \n",
    "However, if we plan to have a cheaper buffet restaurant, it points to the masses looking for affordable high-traffic locations in large shopping centers and other local points of interest. \n",
    "Therefore, it is evident that in order to survive in such a fiercely competitive market, it is very important to systematically and startegically plan. There are various factors need to be studied and considered inorder to decide on the most effective location."
